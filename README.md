# Complete The Calculator Assighnment

## Learning Goals

- Understand Event handling and Dom Manipulation.

## Introduction

In this assignment you will create a calculato using javascript. This lesson is
your first assignment!

All assignments are hosted on GitHub. In order to work on them, however, you
will need to complete work on your local machine.

- Download your personal copy (referred to as 'cloning') to your computer
- Navigate to  `js ` folder then  `main.js`
- Start working this folder 
- Complete the required work

In this assignment, you'll learn the workflow that you will be using to complete
your assignments. You can follow along with the steps in the videos below, or
continue reading to get a more detailed explanation of the process of working on
lessons in Canvas.

## Instruction to Completing Calculator Assignment


***The calculator fuctionality:***

- Calculator can calculate total
- Has all calculator functionalities i.e addition, subtraction, divition, Multiplication etc.

- Next, we have to define the different operations that the calculator will perform. The first one is the `clear()` function, which will clear all the different variables. The next method is `delete()` for clearing a single number.

- We will also create a function that determines what will occur every time a user clicks on a number to add to the display called `appendNumber(number)`.

- We need a `chooseOperation(operation)` function that controls what will happen anytime a user clicks on any operation button.

- Another key function is `compute()`. It takes the values inside your calculator and displays the result.

- Finally, a `updateDisplay()` function lets us update the values inside of the output.


> **Note:** Use knowledge learned from prevous classes is highly required here.
